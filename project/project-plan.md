# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the impact of electric vehicles to the co2 value in germany

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
Do electric vehicles have a significant impact on the co2 emission value in germany?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project faces the topic emobility in sense of analyzing the impact of electric vehicles on the nature and especially the CO2 emission in germany. This could be used to think about future travel possibilities.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Climate data
* Metadata URL: https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/klimawatch-daten-1990-2018.rdf
* Data URL: https://open-data.bielefeld.de/sites/default/files/Klimawatch%20Daten%201990-2018.csv
* Data Type: CSV

* The Dataset containes different air quality values like CO2 or N2 and shows the time related difference over the past years

### Datasource2: 
* Data URL: https://www.kba.de/DE/Statistik/Fahrzeuge/Neuzulassungen/Umwelt/n_umwelt_node.html;jsessionid=CC5699F2C86867AF53212ED5FAB19CCD.live21303
* Data Type: XSLX

* This Dataset shows the number of new admitted cars with alternate drive over the past years

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Exploring the data
2. Analyzing the co2 emission value over the last 20 years
3. Analyzing the registration of electric vehicles over the last 20 years
